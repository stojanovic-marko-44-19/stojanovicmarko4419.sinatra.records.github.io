                <p class="blueColor textAlignJustify lineMarginBottom">Sinatra Records offers our partners 3 basic deals on which mutual cooperation will be based. The first deal includes the production part starting from writing the lyrics all the way to recording the sound on vinyls or CDs. The second deal is of a distributive nature and it starts from marketing operations to the physical delivery of products to intermediaries or end users. My Way deal consists of both production and distribution of the product completing the entire process through our company. In negotiations with our company we can discuss the details like length of contract, purchase price of copyright on the product and sales cut so you can reach a deal with us that suits you best and to do this, like Ol' Blue Eyes said, your way!</p>
