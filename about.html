                <p class="blueColor textAlignJustify lineMarginBottom">Sinatra Records was founded in 1947 by one of the most recognized singers of all time, Frank Sinatra, based on his previous success on the radio. Initially, Sinatra Records only produced Frank's albums, but in 1960 it began distributing his albums. In the mid-1960s, the company began producing and distributing albums and other artists of various genres. 1966 occupies an important place in the history of Sinatra Records, because then Frank's album Strangers in the Night was released as the company's first album on cassette tape. Sinatra Records entered the CD market in 1991 with the release of Robert Flack's album Set the Night to Music. After the death of Frank Sinatra in 1998, his son Frank Sinatra Junior became the owner and CEO of Sinatra Records. In 2000, Sinatra Records stopped making albums on cassette tape, and in 2010 it stopped selling albums of this format. In 2016, after the death of Frank Sinatra Junior, the grandson of the legendary Frank Sinatra, Michael Sinatra, took over the leadership of Sinatra Records.</p>

                <p class="whiteColor textAlignJustify lineMarginBottom">The mission of Sinatra Records is to create high-quality music records which will be appreciated not only by today's critics opinion and sales but also by generations to come. In other words our main goal is to produce songs that shall not be part of any time periode in music history but to be among every periode to come like the Frank Sinatra's songs are. Music can be utilized for many purposes like relaxation, fun or expression of the most different kinds of feelings like thrill and melancholy or longing and belonging. But the very essence of Sinatra Records's mission is the substantial meaning of the music itself and that is to help bringing people together. Music has proved to be strong enough to tear the walls among people down and to bring them close no matter on race, nation or gender. We found our mission accomplished if any of songs we produced were part of people's lovely moments which they will not ever forget. Our vision is to become the US largest record company without music market would be almost impossible to imagine.</p>
